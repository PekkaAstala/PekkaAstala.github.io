     After graduating from KEUDA and starting my college studies, one of my old teachers contacted me and asked if I would like to teach a few courses at KEUDA.
     That paid well so I planned, taught and graded a total of five courses in web development, multimedia and information systems.
     After one year I decided I had too many things going on at the same time (studies, goMob start-up, teaching...) and decided to drop it.

    As a child of a Software Architect I have never really even considered other careers.
